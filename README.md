### WHY MULTIPLE THREADS

Multithreaded programs can improve performance compared to original programs (which use only a single thread).

Multithreading is used as an underlying technique in various fields:

- Web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox...).
- Web servers.
- Graphics editors (Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw...).
- Computer games.
- Database management systems.
- Networking programming.
- Video encoders.
- And more...

In fact, multithreading is extremely important in the current software industry. It let you do concurrency. It solves asynchronous problems.
